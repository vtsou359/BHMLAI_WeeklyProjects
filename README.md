2. **2.2_Creating and Interpreting a Pair Plot**: Creates and interprets pair plots and correlation matrices for penguin and automotive datasets.
3. **3.1_Creating Data Visualizations**: Analyzes and visualizes electoral democracies and autocracies data across different years globally.
4. **4.1_Customer Profiling__Data Analysis**: Performs customer profiling and data analysis to extract insights from customer data.
5. **4.2_Exploring Credit Risks_DataAnalysis**: Explores credit risk factors through data analysis techniques.
6. **6.1_Summarizing Data with PCA**: Applies Principal Component Analysis to summarize and reduce dimensionality of data.
7. **6.2_Interpreting the Results of K-Means and PCA**: Interprets clustering results from K-Means algorithm combined with PCA.
8. **8.1_FeatureEng and Overfitting_The Best Model**: Explores feature engineering techniques while avoiding overfitting to build optimal models.
9. **9.0_CrossValidation**: Implements and compares different cross-validation techniques for model evaluation.
10. **9.1_FeatureSelectionMethod_LASSO vs. SFS**: Compares LASSO and Sequential Feature Selection methods for feature selection.
11. **9.2_Regression_Predicting Wages**: Builds regression models to predict wages based on various factors.
